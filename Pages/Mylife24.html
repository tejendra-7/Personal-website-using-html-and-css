      I have started to learn programming in spetember 2021 after sucessfully finishing my Apeamcet exam and Jee mains exam. Back then i took a web development course in udemy during independence day sale 
      but right after my eamcet exam i am bussy in search of collages and the counselling process and also tensed about my result whcih made me not properly concentrate on what i am learning so i learnt only
      a very little about web development.So then the college started and in december so that is again another big trouble which made me travell in bus for more than 2 hours for going and coming.For one month 
      college is only half days but coming home and eating and sleeping all togather i would again start opeining my laptop after 6 pm. <br> <br>
      so in this way somehow i completed learning Javascript whcih is the most improtant programming skill need for webdevelopment but only upto the concept of functions only.I don't know what happened suddenly i 
      just stipped learning the course due to college work the assignments,mid, internal and external lab and semisters and along with them fest these all togather wasted my time a lot.And i also did a big mistake 
      which is i stopped web devlopment and started leaning python in middle , learnt canva also started to facinate about this crypto and all and started leaning about crypto and started to make digital content and 
      completely avoided web developemnt.</b> <br> <br>
      
      <b>
      So instead of investing all my energy in learnign a single thig i invested it in to explore 10 different things so till now i have just explored and understood different tech fields and other things.
      And finally its July 30th 2022 almost 1 year got completed i have leant so many differnt things and explored al the stuff but did not even properly completely learnt one single skill this the biggest mistake i 
      made in this complete year.So now i promised myself to first learn webdevelopment completly and master this skill then only any other thing until then no distractions towards other fields and no diving or exploring 
      or time wasiting by peeping into other fields and looking for new course.First complete Angela Yu full stack web developer bootcamp and become a certified webdeveloper.
